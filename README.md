**Real-Time AI Voice Agent**  
A real-time voice agent built using LiveKit Agents, AssemblyAI for Speech-to-Text (STT), Cartesia for Text-to-Speech (TTS), Mistral / OpenAI LLMs, and Silero Voice Activity Detection (VAD).

This project enables real-time, bidirectional voice interactions with AI models by combining streaming audio processing with large language models, allowing practical use cases such as conversational assistants, voice-driven applications, and real-time natural language dialogue systems.
